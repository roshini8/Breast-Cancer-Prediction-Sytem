# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Sytem

Breast Cancer Prediction System Project was started by Roshini and Herish

 **Breast Cancer Prediction System**

This project focuses on building a breast cancer prediction system using machine learning. It involves various stages, including data preprocessing, model development, training, evaluation, and testing. The goal is to predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant based on a dataset of breast cancer attributes.

**Requirements**

Before running the project, make sure you have the following requirements installed:

- Python 3.x (e.g., Python 3.7)
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the code interactively)

**Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. It contains various attributes related to breast cancer tumors, including features like radius, texture, perimeter, and more. The dataset is typically split into training and testing sets, allowing the machine learning model to learn from the training data and evaluate its performance on unseen data.

**Project Workflow**

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Import and prepare the breast cancer dataset.
   - Handle missing values, if any.
   - Encode categorical variables (if applicable).
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Creation**:
   - Build machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors.
   - Fine-tune model hyperparameters (e.g., number of estimators, kernel type, neighbors, etc.).

3. **Model Training**:
   - Train the models using the training dataset.
   - Utilize techniques like cross-validation to assess model performance.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and recall.
   - Create confusion matrices to visualize model performance.

5. **Feature Importance Analysis**:
   - Determine the importance of each feature in predicting breast cancer.
   - Visualize feature importance using plots or charts.

6. **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curves**:
   - Plot ROC curves to assess the models' ability to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors.

7. **Feature Selection** (optional):
   - Explore feature selection techniques to identify the most informative attributes for prediction.
   - Re-evaluate model performance with selected features.

8. **Summary of Model Performances**:
   - Provide a summary of accuracy scores for all models tested.
   - Select the best-performing model for breast cancer prediction.

This project aims to assist in the early detection of breast cancer, providing a valuable tool for healthcare professionals in diagnosing patients. It utilizes machine learning to analyze breast cancer data and make predictions, potentially contributing to improved patient outcomes and early intervention.
